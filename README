A toy implementation of monocular ORBSlam written in python.
I got bored one day lmao

How to SLAM:
The instructions outlined here will be with reference to the information provided by
Hartley and Zisserman in 'Multiple View Geometry in computer vision' (Chapter 10 provides
a more in-depth explanation on the Reconsutction of a 3D scene given 2D images)
 - Find pixel correspondences between both sequentially adjacent images using
 ORB and KNN.
 - Compute the epipolar plane and line formed by the two images given corresponding keypoints
 - Given the above parameters, compute the Fundamental Matrix F or Essential Matrix E.
 - Compute the Camera matrix P' given the initial camera matrix P and the chosen matrix from
 the step above.
 - Triangulate points in 3D 
 - Reset camera matrix - change position of the camera in space based on the information found
 from the previous steps.
 - Repeat
